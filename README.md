# SendWhatsappScript
literally source code of a part of [Matt Fontes's SendScriptWhatsApp JS script](https://github.com/Matt-Fontes/SendScriptWhatsApp), you can customize the text wherever you want it to be.
| DUE TO CHROME'S NEW UPDATE, YOU CANT USE THE SCRIPT ANYMORE.
|--|
|*HOWEVER, YOU CAN USE allow-scripts TO MAKE A WORKAROUND OF IT.*
|*AFTER THAT, COPY THE SCRIPT LIKE NORMAL AND ADD YOUR TEXT.*

## ultilization
- open the console of your browser (right click on the camera thingy on whatsapp -> inspect -> console)
- copy the script, and on the *"text here"* put the text you want to

*enjoy ;)*
