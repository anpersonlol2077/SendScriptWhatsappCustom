# SendWhatsappScript
literally source code of a part of Matt Fontes's SendScriptWhatsApp JS script, you can customize the text wherever you want it to be.
| DUE TO CHROME'S NEW UPDATE, YOU CANT USE THE SCRIPT ANYMORE.
|--|
|*HOWEVER, YOU CAN USE allow-scripts TO MAKE A WORKAROUND OF IT.*
|*AFTER THAT, COPY THE SCRIPT LIKE NORMAL AND ADD YOUR TEXT.*

*enjoy ;)*
